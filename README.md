## 🚀 Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

## 🧪 Visual Regression Testing

This project uses Playwright for visual regression testing to ensure UI consistency. Tests are run manually before deploys.

### Running Tests

```sh
# Build site first (tests run against built output)
pnpm run build

# Run visual regression tests
pnpm run test

# Run tests in interactive UI mode
pnpm run test:ui

# Update snapshots after intentional UI changes
pnpm run test:update
```

### Updating Snapshots

After making intentional UI changes:

1. Run `pnpm run build`
2. Run `pnpm run test:update`
3. Commit the updated snapshots in `tests/visual.spec.ts-snapshots/`
